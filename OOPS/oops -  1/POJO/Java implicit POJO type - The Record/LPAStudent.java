// RECORD in Java/POJO

//The POJO vs. The Record
//IN the Plain Old Java Object,  we know that it comes with a lot of what we call boilerplate code.
//It's code that's repetitive and follows certain rules.
//Once created, this code is rarely looked at, or modified.
// In fact, there are tools that'll just regenerate all of this code, if your underlying data, or domain model changes.


//The Record type :
//The record was introduced in JDK 14, and became officially part of Java in JDK 16.
//It's purpose is to replace the boilerplate code of the POJO, but to be more restrictive.
//Java calls them "plain data carriers".

//The record is a special class that contains data, that's not meant to be altered.
//In other words, it seeks to achieve immutability, for the data in its members.
//It contains only the most fundamental methods, such as constructors and accessors.
//Best of all, you the developer, don't have to write or generate any of this code.

//What does Java tell us about what is implicitly created, when we declare a record as we did in this code?
//public record LPAStudent(String id, String name, String dateOfBirth, String classList) {}
//First, it's important to understand that the part that's in parentheses, is called the record header
//The record header consists of record components, a comma delimited list of components.

//For each component in the header, Java generates:
//A field with the same name and declared type as the record component.
//The field is declared private and final.
//The field is sometimes referred to as a component field.

//Java generates a toString method that prints out each attribute in a formatted String.
//In addition to creating a private final field for each component, Java generates a public accessor method for each component.
//This method has the same name and type of the component, but it doesn't have any kind of special prefix, no get, or is, for example.
//The accessor method, for id in this example, is simply id().

//Why is the record built to be immutable?
//There are more use cases for immutable data transfer objects, and keeping them well encapsulated.
//You want to protect the data from unintended mutations.

//If you want to modify data on your class, you won't be using the record.
//You can use the code generation options for the POJO, as we showed in the earlier video.
//But if you're reading a whole lot of records, from a database or file source, and simply passing this data around, then the record is a big improvement.
