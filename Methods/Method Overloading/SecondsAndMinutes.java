//In this challenge, we're going to create a method, that takes time, represented in seconds, as the parameter.
// We'll then want to transform the seconds into hours. 
// Next we'll display the time in hours, with the remaining minutes and seconds, in a String.
// We'll do this transformation in two steps, which allows us to use overloaded methods.
// We want to create two methods with the same name:  getDurationString
// The first method has one parameter of type int, named seconds.
// The second method has two parameters, named minutes and seconds, both ints.
// Both methods return a String in the format shown:â€˜XXh YYm ZZsâ€™where XX represents the number of hours,
// YY the number of minutes, and ZZ the number of seconds.
// The first method should in turn call the second method to return its results.

// Make both methods public and static .
// Remember that one minute is 60 seconds, and one hour equals 60 minutes, or 3600 seconds.
// Start by creating a new project, and call it SecondsAndMinutesChallenge.

//Add validation to the methods as a bonus:
// For the first method, the seconds parameter should be  >= 0.
// For the second method, the minutes parameter should be >= 0, and the seconds parameter should be >= 0, and <= 59.
// If either method is passed an invalid value, print out some type of meaningful message to the user.
